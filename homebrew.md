# Package managers - Homebrew

## Description
Homebrew is the missing package manager for MacOS.

## Installation
Paste the following into a terminal:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
> Visit the Homebrew [homepage](https://brew.sh/) for more information about the installation script.

> Note: homebrew is only available on MacOS , Linux distributions usualy come with their own package manager. By learning Homebrew, it will be much easier to lean how to work with other package managers.

> Note: if you are on Linux, you will use a different package manager. On Debian based systems like Ubuntu or Raspbian you can use a package manager called apt, which is also described in this course.

## Configuration
Simply run the installation script and follow the instructions.

## Usage
All basic operations are explained perfectly on the Homebrew [homepage](https://brew.sh/).
